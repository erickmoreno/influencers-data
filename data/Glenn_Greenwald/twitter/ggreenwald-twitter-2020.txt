2020-06-18 17:19:18+00:00; ggreenwald; @daveweigel Exactly. My objection is to the assumption that Bolton is telling the truth. The scummy, deliberate decision of @Kombiz to screen-shot the tweet so nobody could hear the video allowed that distortion but the point is about the media's assumption that Bolton is telling the truth.; 19; 6; 1; 1; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1273666612663631872; None; None

2020-05-13 23:38:39+00:00; ggreenwald; @BillTsamis The list of people released today aren't necessarily people who unmasked Flynn's calls.

2020-01-03 20:51:31+00:00; ggreenwald; @folha Segundo: uma coluna no @Estadao, como a mídia falhou em seu dever, publicando sem verificar quaisquer acusações que LJ vazou, no processo de destruir as reputações e transformar Moro em um herói. Tb mostra que a #VazaJato foi uma reportagem vital.  https://t.co/wb1xNPoVc7; 485; 19; 131; 8; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1213201243297984513; None; None
2020-01-03 20:44:50+00:00; ggreenwald; Ontem, foram publicados 2 artigos cruciais sobre a corrupção de Lava Jato e Moro - primeiro, uma entrevista da @Folha com o juiz Nino Oliveira Toldo, ex-fervoroso defensor de Moro, sobre como a #VazaJato revelou impropriedades graves por Moro e LJ: https://t.co/vCTMnAsEPo https://t.co/vxtFF6sodc; 871; 27; 280; 6; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1213199562501963778; None; None
2020-01-03 20:14:41+00:00; ggreenwald; Os EUA amam e são viciados em guerra.  O governo dos EUA bombeia constantemente vários países e mata quem quer, porque acredita que é o dono do mundo.  Acredita-se há décadas e compila lucro e poder ao fazê-lo. Só isso.; 13262; 359; 2021; 99; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1213191975970770944; None; None

2020-01-03 18:55:28+00:00; ggreenwald; Unfortunately, endless war - in the Middle East and otherwise - is a longstanding orthodoxy of the establishment wings of both parties. It feeds the US economy and its hegemony. Trump won in part by running against this mindless militarism, and now is an embodiment of it.; 1491; 362; 402; 131; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1213172041215549452; None; None
2020-01-03 18:54:15+00:00; ggreenwald; If you want to impeach Trump, executing an act of war against Iran without Congress - one of the most reckless uses of military force in years - is a valid &amp; just basis to do so.  It's also a complete negation of the #MAGA agenda: followers should have the dignity to object: https://t.co/utJZwXpcWd; 3754; 624; 976; 147; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1213171731197841408; None; https://twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/1213103439363936256
