2019-11-20 16:29:50+00:00; ggreenwald; @BenjaminPDixon And to extend the scope out further: I believe that Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff probably violated the law in how she borrowed and accounted for credit from the state bank, but I was and still am vehemently opposed to her impeachment.; 2; 1; 0; 0; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1197190321974730753; None; None
2019-11-20 16:28:42+00:00; ggreenwald; @BenjaminPDixon I believe Bill Clinton broke the law - including lying under oath in a sexual harassment lawsuit - but I still believe, despite his lawbreaking, that his impeachment and removal from office was unwarranted.

2019-11-20 16:26:42+00:00; ggreenwald; @tomgara @AdamSerwer @cjane87 I find it genuinely bizarre that this question is supposed to be off limits when there's an impeachment inquiry ongoing, especially when you have very prominent journalists explicitly advocating it in viral tweets:   https://t.co/7DRZE0WbS5; 5; 7; 0; 0; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1197189533063958529; None; None

2019-11-20 16:08:57+00:00; ggreenwald; @freedaaron @AdamSerwer I think having the country watch Nancy Pelosi be installed in the Oval Office even though the Democrats lost the presidential election would have massive consequences that would endure for a long time.; 5; 7; 1; 4; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1197185067237416960; None; None

2019-10-30 00:31:51+00:00; ggreenwald; The report, from Globo's @jornalnacional, shows logs from Bolsonaro's gated community: one of the police officer's arrested for Marielle's assassination visited Jair's house shortly before going to kill Marielle.

2019-06-09 21:07:00+00:00; ggreenwald; 5/ In sum, the process that imprisoned Lula &amp; rendered him ineligible to run - paving the way for Bolsonaro's ascension to power - was fueled by wrongdoing, politicized abuse of power &amp; deceit: all of which will now be revealed due to this massive leaked archive of their secrets. https://t.co/3scD3KmpiC; 3325; 95; 1477; 115; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1137828466714431489; None; None
2019-06-09 21:05:44+00:00; ggreenwald; 4/ Also, truly explosive: Sergio Moro, then a judge but now Bolsonaro's Justice Minister, secretly plotted with the prosecutors to construct the exact criminal case against Lula he then judged: a glaring violation of judicial ethics &amp; basic justice: https://t.co/UdfuTzpTOs; 2717; 42; 1266; 87; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1137828145833435138; None; None

2019-06-07 15:35:32+00:00; ggreenwald; The belief that large tech corporations will exercise censorship powers in a way that represses majoritarian power &amp; protects the voiceless and marginalized is so blatantly false, ahistorical, naive, authoritarian &amp; backward that it genuinely shocks me even one person believes it https://t.co/wTDJZ4Nuta; 645; 45; 249; 13; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1137020272048037889; None; https://twitter.com/daphnehk/status/1137014885722681345
2019-06-07 15:17:23+00:00; ggreenwald; So if I'm understanding this correctly, it turns out that once you start cheering for censorship frameworks because you hate the first target, that framework will eventually end up silencing those you also like: deliberately or otherwise https://t.co/W6a7eE7lYS; 4021; 330; 1477; 123; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1137015705046528001; None; None
2019-06-07 13:30:36+00:00; ggreenwald; It continues to seem like a dangerous and reckless campaign to ratchet up tensions between two nuclear-armed powers with decades of entrenched institutional animosity, particularly given how many times these two countries have come close to catastrophic nuclear exchanges: https://t.co/7Z4JoEbcKj; 289; 51; 98; 7; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1136988830949675008; None; https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1136988193163743232

2019-04-12 12:02:45+00:00; ggreenwald; @neoconsocialib The indictment of Assange was issued in 2018, 2 years after Obama left office. Why do I read replies on Twitter?????; 9; 3; 1; 0; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1116673002282868738; None; None
2019-04-12 12:00:53+00:00; ggreenwald; Many leading Dems genuinely believe Assange should be imprisoned not because of what Trump DOJ claims he did (that's why Obama DOJ chose not to indict him for it) but because publishing docs that undermine Hillary is a crime. Schumer said this explicitly: https://t.co/Z3gxlxvfR7; 667; 50; 234; 5; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1116672535373012992; None; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1116515922980765697
2019-04-12 11:58:48+00:00; ggreenwald; Just think about what this reflects about Dems generally &amp; Obama officials specifically: they knew everything Trump DOJ knew but decided Assange shouldn't be prosecuted.

2019-04-12 11:53:30+00:00; ggreenwald; What changed for Dems? Why, when they had power under Obama, did they choose *not to prosecute Assange* on the ground doing so would endanger press freedoms, but now cheer Trump DOJ for indicting him? The answer is obvious: Assange published docs that made Dems look bad in 2016. https://t.co/CirzOx0QaL; 479; 46; 186; 4; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1116670676134518787; None; None

2019-03-13 14:13:39+00:00; ggreenwald; I just find it staggering that Beinart wrote an entire article today suggesting that "leftists"- but not Beinart himself - tried to find value in Carlson's anti-war views, when it was Beinart was *the leading voice* in doing that, in @TheAtlantic. Look at Beinart's own words: https://t.co/lBgFkZpxMW; 247; 21; 51; 1; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1105834309489958912; None; None
2019-03-13 14:10:28+00:00; ggreenwald; What's even more bizarre is that Beinart lists a long group of leftists that he says believed Carlson was useful for his anti-war posture.

2019-03-13 13:08:47+00:00; ggreenwald; The claim they were ideologically motivated in assassinating Marielle is plausible but should not be used to suggest they acted alone or they weren't ordered to do it for money.

2019-01-09 14:02:05+00:00; ggreenwald; @abgutman The problem with cable news is that the format is inherently limited by time. It thus suffers from the same constraints (albeit to a lesser extent than FB &amp; Twitter) that reward polemics &amp; insults over substance. Longer-form venues (podcasts) are key.
