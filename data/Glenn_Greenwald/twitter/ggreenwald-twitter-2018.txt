2018-09-15 13:01:29+00:00; ggreenwald; @transscribe The people who I cited who took "contrarian stands" are named Martina Navratilova (https://t.co/ThcyL2WNkf) and Billie Jean King (https://t.co/sApksHnUPD), who I think have a fair amount of moral authority on these matters and who aren't pundits.; 1; 1; 1; 0; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1040948718390968320; None; None
2018-09-15 12:59:57+00:00; ggreenwald; @transscribe The penalties are automatic, not discretionary. The second code violation (the racquet abuse) had an *automatic* point penalty. Here's John McEnroe being *defaulted* from a Grand Slam match after his third code violation due to the same framework:  https://t.co/pCau1NcMZg; 1; 2; 2; 1; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1040948333781512192; None; None
2018-09-15 12:57:03+00:00; ggreenwald; @kdrum @bmaz @Martina Totally agree. That's the point I was making here. Umpires sit up in a chair and have power-making authority.

2018-09-15 12:48:03+00:00; ggreenwald; Others have noted the glaringly disproportionate media coverage the Salazar *State Senate* race received.

2018-09-15 12:28:43+00:00; ggreenwald; @bmaz @Martina Right, there are a lot of layers to the power imbalance in a scenario like this.

2018-09-15 12:23:08+00:00; ggreenwald; @regisphilibert Thanks.

2018-09-15 12:19:21+00:00; ggreenwald; @bmaz @Martina The problem is that the third code violation is an *automatic* game penalty.

2018-08-29 13:56:46+00:00; ggreenwald; For those suggesting the CNN scandal is insignificant - that CNN getting caught telling an outright lie to the world about its sourcing, and now refusing to acknowledge it, is trivial - watch how they described the importance this story when they first unveiled it: https://t.co/CKp8tDCoAH; 4436; 455; 2279; 241; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1034802039077916674; None; None
2018-08-29 13:23:16+00:00; ggreenwald; "A stalwart friend of the Kingdom," says the Saudi regime in its homage to John McCain, correctly. That's just one of the reasons why the attempt to convert McCain, a warmonger and devoted Saudi ally, into a **human rights defenders** of all things is so grotesque: https://t.co/VoLFrR0tiZ; 1489; 46; 574; 14; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1034793609038577664; None; https://twitter.com/SaudiEmbassyUSA/status/1034792890726273024
2018-08-29 13:14:21+00:00; ggreenwald; 9/ I guess I'd be remiss if I failed to note that while the @NewYorker on the eve of the Iraq War was maligning Chomsky - one of the few prominent War on Terror dissidents - it was publishing @JeffreyGoldberg on how Saddam had an alliance with Al Qaeda &amp; other insane conspiracies https://t.co/HgQfwrfGbl; 270; 21; 77; 3; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1034791363437576192; None; None

2018-08-29 13:04:28+00:00; ggreenwald; 5/ Then come all the personality attacks: Chomsky is angry, humorless, bullying and even "violent." The @NewYorker actually wrote: "Chomsky is an extraordinarily violent man."

2018-08-29 13:02:46+00:00; ggreenwald; 4/ Then we have the sad tone-policing lament about Chomsky used to be so nuanced, balanced and hopeful back in the day, but now he's become rigid, mean, sarcastic and bitter toward well-meaning people. https://t.co/ekC2RMv8L8; 106; 6; 33; 0; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1034788450564812802; None; None
2018-08-29 13:00:15+00:00; ggreenwald; 4/ Then we have: as Chomsky has alienated good, mainstream liberals, he has become bizarrely welcomed by and comfortable with far-right bigots (all because they praised him for his free speech defenses of anti-semites and European nationalists) https://t.co/s9GQpUIH6u; 257; 8; 64; 2; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1034787817610780672; None; None

2018-08-29 12:57:50+00:00; ggreenwald; 2/ Here we have: Chomsky used to be so beloved by mainstream liberals during the Vietnam War, but now even his own liberal allies have turned against him because he has no ideas to offer, is against their wars, as has become too dogmatic &amp; anti-American https://t.co/93XVp57mM3 https://t.co/v1Wb39sPyj; 342; 13; 107; 3; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1034787210162315264; None; None
2018-08-29 12:55:26+00:00; ggreenwald; 1/ In the wake of the @NewYorker profile, several people recommended I look at the ugly 2003 hit piece that magazine did on Chomsky (on the even of the Iraq War) &amp; 2008 attack on Naomi Klein after "Shock Doctrine."

2018-08-29 11:48:57+00:00; ggreenwald; CNN's strategy here is as obvious as it is lame: pretend it's just a scandal among the "right."

2018-08-29 11:47:32+00:00; ggreenwald; The newsletter from CNN's media reporters pretends to address the scandal surrounding its "blockbuster" Cohen debacle, but it entirely ignores - like the network itself - the key problem: their reporters outright lied when they said Lanny Davis (their source) refused comment. https://t.co/0PinUAlhl4; 1559; 70; 786; 56; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1034769516415344640; None; None

2018-08-28 22:56:19+00:00; ggreenwald; Here @FT makes a key point about the fascist Congressman, @jairbolsonaro, leading Brazil's 2018 presidential polls (election is Oct 7).

2018-08-28 22:45:08+00:00; ggreenwald; The next time Trump posts a mean tweet about the media, maybe it's worth suspending the melodrama and outrage about it, and instead spend a few minutes on why he calculates that turning the media into his prime adversary - running against the media - is an effective strategy?; 1372; 120; 439; 25; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1034572619889209344; None; None
2018-08-28 22:43:40+00:00; ggreenwald; In sum: everyone knows CNN - in what it touted as a "blockbuster" story, one of the biggest yet in the Trump/Russia saga - almost certainly told a major, purposeful lie which they refuse to acknowledge. But like Joy Reid's hacker, it's fine because it was for the right reasons.; 1756; 45; 736; 32; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1034572249062363141; None; None
2018-08-28 20:30:59+00:00; ggreenwald; CNN has painted itself into a tiny, twisted corner. Is there anyone who doubts that this sentence in its "blockbuster" story was flat out false? If it's not false, how they can refuse to explain it?

2018-08-28 20:21:12+00:00; ggreenwald; The reason @jimsciutto and @carlbernstein won't admit what is obvious - that Lanny Davis was one of their sources - is because they said the exact opposite in their original story: "Contacted by CNN, one of Cohen's attorneys, Lanny Davis, declined to comment." This is shocking. https://t.co/abhVWUjoNP; 2683; 156; 1232; 84; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1034536397745610757; None; https://twitter.com/perlberg/status/1034532703813730304

2018-08-28 19:58:15+00:00; ggreenwald; You can't demand transparency from other institutions, or feign outrage over public deceit, when you announce "blockbuster" stories that turn out to be false, and then refuse to answer any questions about what appear to be serious lies your reporters told https://t.co/6mmNtkY5dU; 2789; 165; 1223; 74; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1034530620813258757; None; None
2018-08-28 19:56:19+00:00; ggreenwald; There are good reporters at CNN, and - just like when CNN unveiled its huge humiliating debacle about how Trump Jr. got special advanced access to the WikiLeaks archive, then refused to explain how they got it so wrong - they're embarrassed when CNN does things like this: https://t.co/XltYVEM86W; 286; 15; 111; 7; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1034530135381340162; None; None

2018-07-13 19:07:50+00:00; ggreenwald; In most cases, it's so basic that unproven allegations by a prosecutor in an indictment shouldn't be accepted as true one need not even point it out. In this case, pointing it out will be seen as blasphemy.

2018-07-07 07:40:56+00:00; ggreenwald; @theminorchords @TVietor08 @johnjcook My only point there is that if CIA or NSA had evidence of Trump colluding with Russians to hack DNC or Podesta, it seems likely - given how much they've leaked about him - that it'd have been leaked by now.

2018-06-21 14:12:48+00:00; ggreenwald; @bumpasaurus @SteveSeuser I think it's funny that you believe that in the 1970s, when ACLU defended the right of Nazis to march through a neighborhood filled with Holocaust survivors, that no rich people supported white supremacy.

2018-06-21 14:09:34+00:00; ggreenwald; @TolchinImm My position is that the ACLU should maintain, not retreat from, its decades-long free speech position as illustrated and explained here: https://t.co/706usLimst; 117; 3; 16; 1; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1009800497895702528; None; None
2018-06-21 14:04:11+00:00; ggreenwald; The day the ACLU becomes just another liberal political group, subordinating its core free speech mission to those political policy preferences, is the day it loses its unique value.

2018-06-21 13:40:46+00:00; ggreenwald; @bsonenstein Right - though it's a broader pathology of Democrats: they think that not only Obama, but they themselves, are inherently Good and noble, so that when they do horrible things, kill people, etc., it's with a kind and good heart and that mitigates the evil of the act.; 128; 8; 28; 2; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1009793248787947521; None; None
2018-06-21 13:38:16+00:00; ggreenwald; Knowing ACLU &amp; so many of its lawyers as I do, I doubt it will renounce &amp; retreat from its decades-old, brave, stalwart defense of free speech because of political pressure.

The issue is if her "I-was-hacked!" denials **now** are true.

2018-04-12 13:03:14+00:00; ggreenwald; The idea that opposition to Trump is such a defining moral question it excuses explicitly joining forces with neocons, torturers and war criminals - people who would be in a cell in the Hague if the US weren't exempt from war crimes - is, to my mind, misguided, to put it mildly.; 1757; 58; 526; 40; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/984416654837932035; None; None
2018-04-12 12:59:01+00:00; ggreenwald; @NoahCRothman You repeatedly tweeted he was a "Russian stooge" pushing "Russian propaganda" and is "ostensibly patriotic" - all because he questioned the evidence for the newest Trump/neocon war. Why did you do that? Because you're a neocon, and neocons smear people who question their wars.; 17; 0; 6; 0; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/984415591489507328; None; None
2018-04-12 12:46:45+00:00; ggreenwald; @fun_cool_facts I'm noting that he's one of the few media figures with a prominent TV platform to be expressing serious skepticism and opposition to Trump's proposed new war.

2018-04-12 12:40:46+00:00; ggreenwald; Benjamin Netanyahu is a humanitarian, deeply concerned about the life of Arab civilians, and is going to deploy the Israeli military for humanitarian ends to save Syrians.

2018-04-12 12:34:51+00:00; ggreenwald; @MarcoDuVall I spent 20 minutes straight in the Democracy Now interview vehemently arguing against western military intervention in Syria.

2018-04-12 12:31:19+00:00; ggreenwald; It's really terrible to be interviewed by that bad TV host.

2018-04-12 12:26:20+00:00; ggreenwald; Perfect illustration of current US politics. The old standard neocon tactic is to smear anyone who opposes their latest war as a supporter of whoever they want to attack (you're pro-Saddam, pro-Gadaffi, etc). Here's a neocon doing this.

2018-04-12 11:57:55+00:00; ggreenwald; Trump - like Obama - has been continually bombing Syria. Trump's bombing (of alleged "terror" targets) escalated, as has his killing of civilians, and I don't know of any Dems who condemned that either.

2018-02-18 19:15:43+00:00; ggreenwald; Right: if you force people, they'll grudgingly concede: "oh yeah, I'm also opposed to 'meddling' by the US." But the amount of time, anger, and denunciation they devote to when US is the target vastly exceeds how much time &amp; energy they devote to opposing when it's done by the US https://t.co/degeAWoYn3; 336; 35; 112; 9; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/965303836024819712; None; https://twitter.com/adamjohnsonNYC/status/965302994563731456

2018-02-18 19:06:55+00:00; ggreenwald; @gusfriedman @HeerJeet The discussion began by discussing an article that was published today on how the US constantly does to other countries exactly what Russia is accused of here (indeed, it does far worse).

2018-02-16 21:45:54+00:00; ggreenwald; @TVietor08 @dandrezner @ThePlumLineGS I don't want to make definitive statements about today's indictment because I haven't studied it carefully enough but my understanding at the moment is that "unwitting" means: the Russians who interfered spoke to Trump officials, who weren't aware of their schemes.; 2; 6; 1; 0; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/964616854395289601; None; None

2018-02-16 21:39:55+00:00; ggreenwald; It's also worth noting, as boring and annoying as it is, that indictments are just allegations from prosecutors, and often end up being proven false or unaccompanied by sufficient evident of their truth.

2018-02-16 21:38:52+00:00; ggreenwald; Right.

2018-01-02 15:39:48+00:00; ggreenwald; The sooner western liberals are forced by Israeli candor to repudiate what they all know is a pretense - that Israel is working in a "peace process" toward a 2-state solution - the better off everyone will be. Giving up that lie will force more truth about what Israel really is.; 664; 35; 306; 14; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/948217266927292416; None; None
2018-01-02 15:38:13+00:00; ggreenwald; Valuable clarity: Israeli government is now candidly &amp; explicitly admitting its real policy. It's not the "peace process." It's not a 2-state solution. It's annexation (i.e. apartheid), and they're doing it now https://t.co/RiDVSWckXd; 1144; 89; 1131; 63; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/948216869873471489; None; None

2018-01-02 00:18:18+00:00; ggreenwald; @adrielhampton Yes, she still has a somewhat robust online following - though many of them have realized they were scammed - but she went over too many lines for anyone in the media to be willing any longer to be seen giving her credence.; 73; 4; 2; 0; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/947985363779407872; None; None
2018-01-02 00:13:28+00:00; ggreenwald; @edwardgorelik She did well what all successful con artists do: she figured out what people wanted and gave it to them. The British accent packaging helped (when will Americans stop viewing that as an indicator of high IQs??), and if you look at her from the right angle, she has a camp appeal.; 135; 10; 9; 1; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/947984149058654208; None; None

2018-01-02 00:03:03+00:00; ggreenwald; @pennywinkie I love so much that the NYT op-ed page (and various MSNBC stars) presented the person who wrote this as a credible expert on Russia and hacking. https://t.co/Zx6GfmVrOi; 9; 2; 1; 0; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/947981526402240512; None; None
2018-01-01 23:59:41+00:00; ggreenwald; The NYT published an op-ed from her, presenting her as a Russia expert giving advice to the Senate about how to conduct its hacking hearings (https://t.co/QYMlf5IEAX). Bill Maher &amp; MSNBC did the same. Her scam had an amazingly good, long run. Worth examining why. https://t.co/aC3Ecs8mzy; 1813; 90; 698; 45; https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/947980679282855937; None; https://twitter.com/charles_kinbote/status/947516478680698881
