# Influencers Data

This repo aims to store ways to aquire public data about brazilian government influencers

## What is an influencer?

We base our list of relevant influencers on public information. 

The first one is the [GPS ideol√≥gico](https://temas.folha.uol.com.br/gps-ideologico/reta-ideologica-2020/a-posicao-ideologica-de-1-8-mil-influenciadores-no-twitter-em-2020.shtml). This tool lists political influencers and their position on political spectrum.

Another source is the brazilian government influencers list created by the government and made public by press.
